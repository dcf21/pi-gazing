This directory contains two XML files which contain the default properties of
each of the lenses and cameras that we use.

These settings are copied into an observatory's local metadata, and can be
overridden on a camera-by-camera basis.

So, for example, if a camera is using a particular lens, it will default to
using the barrel correction parameters stored here. However, it may be more
accurate to rederive new correction parameters for each particular set up.
