# Meteor Pi

Meteor Pi makes it really easy for schools, community groups, and enthusiasts
to observe the night sky.

We're installing a network of CCTV cameras that point upwards and record
pictures of the sky throughout the hours of darkness.  They take a series of
long-exposure still photos each night, and they're also motion sensitive,
taking video clips of anything that moves.

You can use Meteor Pi images to watch how the constellations circle overhead as
the night progresses, or how they change with the seasons. You can see the
changing phases of the Moon, or watch the planets move across the sky.

The motion sensors in our cameras capture footage of planes, satellites, and
shooting stars. We also see rarer phenomena: lightning strikes, fireworks, and
glints of light from solar panels on spacecraft.

The fact that we have a network of many cameras means that sometimes we see the
same object from multiple different locations. That enables us to triangulate
their exact three-dimensional positions, including their altitude and speed.

To find out more about the Meteor Pi project, you should [visit our project
website](http://pigazing.cambridgesciencecentre.org/).

There, you can find information sheets about educational activities, and you
can browse our entire data archive.

These GitHub pages contain all of the program code and hardware designs that we
use. They're all open source, and if you want to set up your own camera using
our software, you should be able to find all the information you need here.

## Our supporters

Meteor Pi was developed by astronomer [Dominic
Ford](https://in-the-sky.org/about.php) for [Cambridge Science
Centre](http://www.cambridgesciencecentre.org/), with generous support from the
[Raspberry Pi Foundation](https://www.raspberrypi.org/), and
[MathWorks](http://uk.mathworks.com).

## Audience

Meteor Pi is open to all!

Many of our activities have been developed with children in mind, but all our
data is open for anyone to access. You can find instructions on these GitHub
pages for building your own camera, and we'd be delighted to hear how you get
on. We're especially keen to work with amateur astronomers who would like to
use our cameras to make scientific observations of meteors, for example as part
of the [NEMETODE](http://www.nemetode.org) and [UKMON]
(http://www.ukmeteornetwork.co.uk) networks.
