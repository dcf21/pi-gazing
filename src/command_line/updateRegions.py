This script is used to manually update an observatory status

Observing regions are used to specify that a particular observatory should only analyse certain portions of the
visible field to look for moving objects (e.g. meteors). This is useful when the field also contains distracting
objects such as buildings, roads, etc, where humans are often moving around.

You should enter a series of coordinate positions which represent the corners of a polygon within which the
observatory should search for moving objects. This is a bit fiddly to do through a commandline interface, so you
may want to use the web interface instead.
