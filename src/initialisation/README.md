This directory contains scripts to install Pi Gazing, including its software
dependencies and the MySQL database that it uses to store observations.

Run the script `install.sh` to install the Pi Gazing software and all of its
dependencies. This will also set up an Apache webserver to host the PiGazing
web interface.

Run the script `flushDatabase.py` to clear out all observations and
observatories from the Pi Gazing database.
