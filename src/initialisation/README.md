This directory contains the SQL schema used by the Meteor Pi archival database.

You must set up the required MySQL user account and database before you can use any other python scripts in our repository.

Run the script `rebuild.sh` to do this. You will need to enter your MySQL root password, and then both the user account and the database will be set up from scratch.

By default, the user name, database name, user name, and password are all `meteorpi`.
