This directory contains the SQL schema used by the Pi Gazing archival database.

You must set up the required MySQL user account and database before you can use
any other python scripts in our repository.

Run the script `main.sh` to do this. You will need to enter your MySQL root
password, and then both the user account and the database will be set up from
scratch.

By default, the user name, database name, user name, and password are all
`pigazing`.
