    <b>Three Pi Gazing cameras being tested side-by-side.</b>
</div>

<p class="text">
    Pi Gazing was developed by astronomer <a href="https://in-the-sky.org/about.php">Dominic Ford</a> for
    Cambridge Science Centre.
    </p>
<p class="text">
    All of the software and hardware designs are open source, and can be downloaded from
    our <a href="https://github.com/camsci/meteor-pi">GitHub pages</a> under a

<p class="text">
    You are very welcome to try building your own Pi Gazing camera. You can either use our software as is, or you can
    play around with it, figure out how it works, and try to make it work better!
</p>
<p class="text">
    If you do build your own camera, please do get in touch with us via Facebook or Twitter. We'd love to keep track
    of where Pi Gazing cameras are being installed.

<h3>Acknowledgments</h3>

<p class="text">
We are very grateful for advice from many amateur astronomers who helped us with the design of Pi Gazing. These include
the <a href="http://www.nemetode.org/">NEMETODE</a> and <a href="https://www.ukmeteornetwork.co.uk/">UKMON</a>
networks of amateur meteor observers.

<p class="text">
    The hardware used in our Pi Gazing cameras was designed by Dave Ansell. Our database
    and communications systems were design by Tom Oinn.
