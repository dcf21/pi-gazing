                                Shooting stars are distinctive, because they move much quicker than planes and
                                satellites. They usually come and go within a fraction of a second, as they burn up in
                                the Earth's atmosphere.

                                you'll only see objects that were gone within a second of first appearing.

                                They move at a steady speed, and unlike planes, don't have flashing lights.
