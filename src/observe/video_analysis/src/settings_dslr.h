// The settings below define how the video capture and analysis works, when we are observing with a DSLR driven
// using gphoto2

#ifndef _SETTINGS_DSLR_H
#define _SETTINGS_DSLR_H 1

// Define the device from which to capture video, and the resolution and frame-rate we expect from it.
// These parameters affect diagnostic routines such as snapshot. Main observe process overrides these with
// data passed on the command line

#define VIDEO_WIDTH  800
#define VIDEO_HEIGHT 600
#define VIDEO_FPS    0.125

// If this flag is set, we assume the camera is mounted upside down. Video is flipped before analysis.
#define VIDEO_UPSIDE_DOWN 0

// This is the mean pixel brightness that we aim for in output images, applying whatever automatic gain is needed to
// get there.
#define STACK_TARGET_BRIGHTNESS  32

// Throttle the number of triggers which are allowed
#define TRIGGER_THROTTLE_PERIOD 30 /* number of minutes */
#define TRIGGER_THROTTLE_MAXEVT  4 /* number of triggers allowed in that time */

// Trigger parameters
#define VIDEO_BUFFER_LENGTH  200  /* maximum period of video to buffer in ram */

#define TRIGGER_PREFIX_TIME   16  /* include N seconds of video after trigger */
#define TRIGGER_SUFFIX_TIME   16  /* include N seconds of video after trigger has gone away */

#define TRIGGER_SUFFIX_TIME_INITIAL 16 /* An object which has only been seen in one frame must recur within this time */

#define TRIGGER_MIN_DETECTIONS  2 /* The minimum number of frames in which a moving object must be detected */
#define TRIGGER_MIN_PATH_LENGTH 4 /* The minimum number of pixels that the moving object must move across the frame */
