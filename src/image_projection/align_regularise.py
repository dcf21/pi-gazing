"""
This script takes a list of images that we have attempted to locate on the sky using astrometry.net. It assumes that
the camera was pointing towards a fixed direction in the sky over the course of the observations, and that the sky
was rotating as sidereal time advanced. It finds the best-fit altitude and azimuth that the camera may have been
pointing at, and then recomputes (more accurate) fits to the central position of each image.

The format that the input file is expected to take is that produced by (for example) <align_gnomonic.py>
These files are also produced by <observatoryControl/orientationCalc.py>
